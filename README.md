>   Install Node.js from nodejs.org. The version used here is v14.15.4 LTS.
>   Clone the folder to your local machine and run it from the Terminal.  
>   The user can provide inputs in the Terminal by running "node app" from the root repo.  
>   When all the inputs are given, the application generates a html file and css file in the folder named 'dist'.  
>   The command line will show the following two messages on success.  
>   >   File created!
